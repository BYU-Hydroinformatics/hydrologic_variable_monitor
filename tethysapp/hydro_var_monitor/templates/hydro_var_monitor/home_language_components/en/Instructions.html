                    <p>Welcome to the Climate Trends App!</p>

                    <p>The Climate Trends App allows you to visualize satellite information for the last 30 years and
                        compare them for variables of interest.</p>
                    <p>To start, select a variable of interest: precipitation, temperature, soil moisture, or evapotranspiration.
                        Then choose the satellite you want to use for your chosen variable.</p>

                    <p>By clicking <span class="bolded">“Load Map”</span> you can visualize a map for that variable and satellite.</p>
                    <p>Next, select an area of interest, a province in Ecuador or latitude and longitude coordinates.</p>
                    <p><span class="bolded">Select a point or area of interest:</span></p>

                    <p><span class="bolded">1. Coordinates:</span> Click the button <span class="bolded">“Enter Lat/Lon”</span>,
                        and a screen will pop up where you can enter the latitude and longitude coordinates for a point. Click <span class="bolded">“Save”</span>,
                        and then <span class="bolded">“Show Graph”</span> to see a graph of the results at that point.</p>

                    <p><span class="bolded">2. Region of Interest: </span> In the upper left-hand corner of map there is an option with two buttons to draw on the map.
                        Select one of the two buttons to draw your area of interest on the map. Click the button
                        <span class="bolded">“Show Graph”</span> to visualize the results.</p>
                    <p><span class="bolded">3. Ecuador Province: </span> At the button of the sidebar menu, choose the button <span
                            class="bolded">¨Load Region Data¨</span>
                        and select the province of interest from the drop-down meny. Finally, click the button <span
                            class="bolded">“Load Region Data”</span> to visualize the results.</p>


                    <p><span class="bolded">Visualize Results</span></p>
                    <p>Once you have selected a variable, satellite and area of interest you can visualize the results on a graph. You can
                        download the results as a .csv, by clicking the button <span class="bolded">“Download”</span>.
                        You can also download the graph in .png format by clicking the camera button located in the top right corner of the graph.</p>
                    <p>On the graph, you can select a date by clicking and selecting a range of dates. You can visualize the original graph again by clicking on
                        Autoscale, which is located near the camera button.</p>
                    <p>You can turn on and off the lines of the graph by clicking on the legend. By default all lines are on.</p>
                    <p><span class="bolded">Compare averages for a variable</span></p>
                    <p>Once you have selected a variable, satellite and area of interest you can compare the averages of the variable for different satellites.
                        To do this, click on the button <span class="bolded">“Compare Averages”</span> located at the bottom of the sidebar menu.</p>
                    <p><span class="bolded">Select a Specific Date</span></p>
                    <p> You can visualize the results by clicking the button <span
                            class="bolded">“Use a Specific Year”</span>.</p>
